## AdditionalData

In this folder we collect data that is important for the project, but should not show up in the unity editor.
For example .svg files to .png sprites for later modification.

If you add a file here that is somehow associated to a file inside the YouVsVirus folder, please add a note here,
to which file it is associated and how.
If you create a new folder, please add a README with a corresponding list in that folder.
