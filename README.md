# youvsvirus-unity
Unity version of the you vs virus game.
This is heavily work in progress. 
We aim at a better web integration of the youvsvirus-game in python.

There are already multiple simulation approaches that illustrate and explain the spread of the coronavirus. These approaches are to be expanded to include the possibility of simulating the effects of one's own actions on the course of the pandemic. Users can simulate their real or fictitious behaviour and get a reaction how this effects others.

Currently a python version is implemented that can be executed locally.
We are now working on an implementation based on unity that can be directly integrated
in our homepage [www.youvsvirus.de](http://www.youvsvirus.de).
